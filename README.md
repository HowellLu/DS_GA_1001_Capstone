# Goals of the project

The main goals of this project are to:

    1. Data Exploration and understanding
    2. Statistical analysis of the Dataset 
    3. Predict Data Science salaries
    
To further refine our understanding we will investigate the following questions:

## Background on Data

The dataset we are using for this project can be found on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/jackogozaly/data-science-and-stem-salaries). The data was scraped from levels.fyi and had some cleaning done to it before being uploaded onto kaggle.

There are 62,000 rows and 29 columns, described below:

## Motivating Factor for this Project

As Data Science graduate students at New York University's Center for Data Science, the team was naturally intrigued to learn what factors are most important with salaries of Data Science and STEM employees.
